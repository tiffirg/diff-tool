# The ring poem in the black speech of mordor
Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul,
ash nazg thrakatulûk,agh burzum-ishi krimpatul,
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie
